# Paleo-Fractal-Math-Foundations
A exploration of how paleo-liticic humans observed and created intuitive efficient systems of Maths and Language to describe what they are observing while preserving information with minimal loss. 

Abstract
Macroscopic definiteness emerges not from observation but from redundant environmental encoding — the core insight of quantum Darwinism. We propose that the same redundancy mechanism operates across scales to select stable cultural patterns that maximize coherence-carrying capacity: the amount of structured information transported into the future per unit of entropy dissipated. Using box-counting and network analysis, we show that the 32 recurring geometric signs of the European Upper Palaeolithic (40,000–10,000 BCE) exhibit finite fractal dimensions (D = 1.0–1.85, mean 1.48), with the densest motifs converging on the same range (1.58–1.68) as the deliberately nested metrological trees of Sumer, Egypt, and the Indus civilization (D ≈ 1.63 for the Ur III system). These self-similar structures — grown from minimal iterative rules — constitute low-dissipation attractors that resist narrative and institutional decoherence. Microtubule quantum coherence (τ > 100 μs at gamma frequencies), inter-brain gamma synchrony during ritual, and archaeo-acoustic resonances (110 Hz in the Hypogeum, 90–110 Hz at Chichén Itzá) provide the physical substrate that amplifies collective pointer-state formation. We formalize the selection pressure as C = τΦ/S and demonstrate its scale invariance from quantum biology to sexagesimal timekeeping. Three falsifiable predictions are offered: (1) enhanced triad-motif recall under 110 Hz acoustic priming, (2) higher phase-locking values in resonant Neolithic chambers, and (3) persistent fractal scaling in any corpus older than 5000 years. The hypothesis reframes myths, measures, and monuments not as folklore or technology but as the classical limit of a single, efficiency-driven process that began rendering reality definite long before minds arrived to notice.
